<li><b>Stop Bleeding:</b></li>

<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Apply direct pressure on the cut or wound with a clean cloth, tissue, or piece of gauze until bleeding stops.</li>

<h3><b>What Are the Degrees of Burns?</b></h3>
<li><b>First-degree:</b></li>
<br>
These burns only affect the outer layer of your skin, called the epidermis. A mild sunburn's one example. Your skin may be red and painful, but you won't have any blisters. Long-term damage is rare.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Second-degree:</b></li>
<br>
If you have this type of burn, the outer layer of your skin as well the dermis - the layer underneath - has been damaged. Your skin will be bright red, swollen, and may look shiny and wet. You'll see blisters, and the burn will hurt to the touch.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Third-degree:</b></li>
<br>
Sometimes called a “full thickness burn,” this type of injury destroys the epidermis and all layers of your skin. Instead of turning red, it may appear black, brown, white or yellow. It won't hurt because this type of burn damages nerve endings.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Fourth-degree:</b></li>
<br>
This is the deepest and most severe of burns. They're potentially life-threatening. These burns destroy all layers of your skin, as well as your bones, muscles, and tendons

<h3><strong>For All Burns:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Stop Burning Immediately:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Put out the fire or stop the person's contact with hot liquid, steam, or other material.</li>
<br>
<li>Help the person "stop, drop, and roll" to smother flames.</li>
<br>
<li>Remove smoldering material from the person.</li>
<br>
<li>Remove hot or burned clothing. If clothing sticks to the skin, cut or tear around it.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Remove Constrictive Clothing Immediately:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Take off jewelry, belts, and tight clothing. Burns can swell quickly.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Then take the following steps:</strong></h4>
<h3><strong>For First-Degree Burns:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Cool Burn:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Hold burned skin under cool (not cold) running water or immerse in cool water until the pain subsides.</li>
<br>
<li>Use compresses if running water isn't available.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Protect Burn:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Cover with sterile, non-adhesive bandage or clean cloth.</li>
<br>
<li>Do not apply butter, oil, lotions, or creams (especially if they contain fragrance). Apply a petroleum-based ointment two to three times per day.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Treat Pain:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Give over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Panadol, Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>When to See a Doctor:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>You see signs of infection, like increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or oozing.</li>
<br>
<li>The person needs tetanus or booster shot, depending on date of last injection. Tetanus booster should be given every 10 years.</li>
<br>
<li>The burn blister is larger than two inches or oozes.</li>
<br>
<li>Redness and pain last more than a few hours.</li>
<br>
<li>The pain gets worse.</li>
<br>
<li>The hands, feet, face, or genitals are burned.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Follow Up:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>The doctor will examine the burn and may prescribe antibiotics and pain medication.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3><strong>For Second-Degree Burns:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Cool Burn:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Immerse in cool water for 10 or 15 minutes.</li>
<br>
<li>Use compresses if running water isn't available.</li>
<br>
<li>Don't apply ice. It can lower body temperature and cause further pain and damage.</li>
<br>
<li>Don't break blisters or apply butter or ointments, which can cause infection.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Protect Burn:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Cover loosely with sterile, nonstick bandage and secure in place with gauze or tape.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Prevent Shock:</b></li>
<h4>Unless the person has a head, neck, or leg injury, or it would cause discomfort:</h4>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Lay the person flat.</li>
<br>
<li>Elevate feet about 12 inches.</li>
<br>
<li>Elevate burn area above heart level, if possible.</li>
<br>
<li>Cover the person with a coat or blanket.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>See a Doctor:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>The doctor can test burn severity, prescribe antibiotics and pain medications, and administer a tetanus shot, if needed.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3><strong>For Third-Degree Burns:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Call 911</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>Protect Burn Area:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Cover loosely with sterile, nonstick bandage or, for large areas, a sheet or other material that that won't leave lint in wound.</li>
<br>
<li>Separate burned toes and fingers with dry, sterile dressings.</li>
<br>
<li>Do not soak the burn in water or apply ointments or butter, which can cause infection.</li>
<br>
</ul>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Lay the person flat.</li>
<br>
<li>Elevate feet about 12 inches.</li>
<br>
<li>Elevate burn area above heart level, if possible.</li>
<br>
<li>Cover the person with a coat or blanket.</li>
<br>
<li>For an airway burn, do not place a pillow under the person's head when the person is lying down. This can close the airway.</li>
<br>
<li>Have a person with a facial burn sit up.</li>
<br>
<li>Check pulse and breathing to monitor for shock until emergency help arrives.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>See a Doctor:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Doctors will give oxygen and fluid, if needed, and treat the burn.</li>
</ul>
</ol>



<h3><strong>For Fourth-Degree Burns:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Call Emergency Services Immediately:</b></li>
<br>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Dial emergency services (such as 911) right away. Fourth-degree burns are life-threatening, and professional medical treatment is essential.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Do Not Remove Clothing or Debris Stuck to the Burned Area:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Avoid trying to remove clothing or objects that are stuck to the burn, as this could worsen the injury and increase the risk of infection.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Keep the Burned Area Elevated (If Possible):</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>If feasible, raise the affected area above heart level to help reduce swelling and manage pain. However, avoid moving the person if it could further injure them.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Cover the Burn with a Cool, Moist, Sterile Cloth:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Use a sterile, non-stick cloth or dressing to cover the burn. Avoid applying ice, cold water, or creams, as these can further damage tissues in severe burns.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Monitor Vital Signs:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Keep a close watch on the person's breathing, pulse, and level of responsiveness. Fourth-degree burns can lead to shock. If they show signs of shock (such as pale, clammy skin, rapid heartbeat, or difficulty breathing), keep them calm and warm until help arrives.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>Prevent Hypothermia:</b></li>
<ul type="circle">
<br>
<li>Cover the person with a clean blanket to help maintain body temperature, but avoid covering the burned area directly.</li>
