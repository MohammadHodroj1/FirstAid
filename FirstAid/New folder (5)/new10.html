        <p>Use a sterile gauze or clean, non-stick bandage to gently cover the burn, avoiding the use of
        Cotton because it may stick to the wound.</p>
        <hr>
        <li>Avoid using non-medical materials:</li>
        <p>Avoid applying household creams, oils, or any non-sterile materials to the burn, 
        as they may contaminate the wound or slow down the healing process.</p>
        <hr>

        <hr>
        <li>Call for medical help if the condition is serious.</li>
